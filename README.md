# MCDM-compromise-ranking
Confused by the diverging results provided by different MCDM methods for the same problem? Now you can exploit the advantages of different methods and simultaneously get one consistent and reliable recommendation based on them - a compromise ranking.

In this script, a method for constructing a compromise ranking based on several solutions to the same decision problem provided by different MCDM methods is implemented. This method combines Borda count and Copeland ranking methodologies and was implemented based on the article:
Ecer, F. (2021). A consolidated MCDM framework for performance assessment of battery electric vehicles based on ranking strategies. Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 143, 110916.

and applied in article:
Bączkiewicz, A., Kizielewicz, B., Shekhovtsov, A., Wątróbski, J., & Sałabun, W. (2021). Methodical Aspects of MCDM Based E-Commerce Recommender System. Journal of Theoretical and Applied Electronic Commerce Research, 16(6), 2192-2229.
